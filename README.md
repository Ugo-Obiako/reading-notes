## Growth Mindset
Individuals that do not give up challenges have a growth mindset. They believe that skills can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others.

***Reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in growth mindset***
1. _Set realistic goals._
2. _Always learn something new._
3. ~~disregard item number three.~~
4. _Seek feedback._
