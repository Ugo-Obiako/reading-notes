# Learn CSS - Flexbox

#### 1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

CSS is essential for controlling the layout of elements on a web page. Flexbox is a layout model that allows you to distribute space among items in a container, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic.

#### 2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row, the main axis is along the row, if it is column, the main axis is along the column.

#### 3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

- Flexbox allows you to change the order of elements visually, which can be useful for responsive design. However, if the order doesn't match the logical order in the HTML document, it can confuse screen readers. 

- If you use display: none; or visibility: hidden; to hide elements within a flex container, the content will be hidden from everyone, including screen readers.
