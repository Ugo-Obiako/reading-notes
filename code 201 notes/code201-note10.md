# Read 10: Debugging

Debugging is an essential part of the software development process. It involves identifying and correcting errors or issues in your code, which ensures that the code functions as expected. 

#### 1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

Syntax errors are spelling errors that occur in code that usually causes the code not to run or to sop running when the error is encountered. Logic errors are errors where the code actually runs successfully but gives unintended or incorrect results.

#### 2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

An error I encounted was missing semicolon at the end of some JavaScript statements. I fixed the errors by including a semicolon at the end of those statements. 

#### 3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

This topic is important because whenever code is written, it needs to be debugged so that it can run successfully. 

# The JavaScript Debugger.

#### 1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript debugger tool allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

#### 2. Define what a breakpoint is.

A breakpoint is a designated point in your code where the debugger will pause the execution of your program, allowing you to inspect and interact with the code's current state. Breakpoints are a crucial tool for diagnosing and fixing issues in JavaScript applications.

#### 3. What is the call stack?

The call stack keeps track of the function calls in the program's execution. The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
