# Read: 08 - Operators and Loops

#### What is an expression in JavaScript?

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. It can be as simple as a single constant value or a complex combination of variables, operators, and function calls. 

#### Why would we use a loop in our code?

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

#### When does a for loop stop executing?

A code containing a for loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true. When the condition becomes false, the loop stops. For a for looop, it is possible to know the exact number of loops by defining it in the condition.

#### How many times will a while loop execute?

The number of times a while loop will execute depends on the condition specified in the loop. A while loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true, and it stops executing as soon as the condition becomes false. If the condition is always true, the loop will run indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop, unless there is a mechanism to break out of it, like using a break statement.
