#### What did this exercise teach you?

I learned about the A-C-P process. The A-C-P process is essential in Git workflows to manage and share code effectively. Below is the A-C-P process.

>git add filename   # Stage a specific file

>git add .          # Stage all change

>git commit -m "commit message"

>git push origin branch-name
