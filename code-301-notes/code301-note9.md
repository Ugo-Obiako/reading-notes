# Read 09: Functional Programming

#### 1. What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. 

#### 2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

Pure functions return the same result if given the same arguments and it does not cause any observable side effects.

#### 3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

Code built with pure functions is easier to test.

#### 4. What is immutability?

#### 5. What is Referential transparency

Referential transparency refers to when a function always returns the same output for the same input with no side effects.
