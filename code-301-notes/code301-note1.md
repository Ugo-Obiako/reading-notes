# What is Props and How to Use it in React

#### What is “props” short for?

props stands for properties.

#### How are props used in React?

In React, props are used to pass data from one component to another. 

#### What is the flow of props?

Data flow through props is unidirectional from the parent component to the child components. The data passed through props from a parent component to a child component is considered read-only within the child component. By default, the child component cannot directly modify the props it receives from the parent component.
